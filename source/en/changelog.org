 To python plugin developers:
 - write plugin in python is more like a preview feature, not all launchy interface is ported to python, and I will keep working on this part to provide a better and more comprehensive support.
 - I rarely develop in python, and I just learned the basics of python, so I need suggestions and advices about python. If you have any idea or I did something wrong, go ahead and post an issue.
 - If you need extra lanchy interface exposed to python, post an issue.

** 3.0.2
 - Verby plugin works now
 - Calcy plugin can convert among octal decimal hexadecimal, this works when input has a trailing equal symbol, try following input: =035== , =35== , =0x35==
 - add skins for high DPI, this may help in 2k or 4k display (Issue [[https://github.com/samsonwang/LaunchyQt/issues/1][#1]])
 - pack additional qt dll (Issue [[https://github.com/samsonwang/LaunchyQt/issues/1][#1]])

** 3.0.0
 - Qt5.11.1, It's 2018 now, migrated to Qt higher version.
 - non-boost dependency, C++11 supports shared_ptr , and I'm trying to get Launchy out of boost library.
 - whole new hotkey implemetation, the hotkey did not work, I tried hard to fix it, but it still failed, so I write a new one.
