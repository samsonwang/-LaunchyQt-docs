Install Addtional Skins
-----------------------

The user interface of Launchy is highly customizable. You can use a skin to change the appearance of Launchy.

I only packed some selected skins in release, you can try the others from `github repo <https://github.com/samsonwang/LaunchyQt/tree/master/skins>`_ .

You may also find a favourite one from `deviantart <https://www.deviantart.com/customization/skins/applaunchers/launchy/newest/>`_ .

**Tips:**
Launchy has two versions of skin system, and I only keep the newest one. If unfortunately you wants to use a old version one from deviantart, it is easy to turn it to a newer one.

Build Your Own Skin
-------------------

Launchy skin is defined in CSS format or `qt stylesheet <http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-syntax.html>`_ format. Just open ``style.qss`` file in any skin folder, and you will find out how a skin works.
