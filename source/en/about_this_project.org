* What is LaunchyQt
Launchy is a free utility designed to help you forget about your start menu, your desktop icons, and your file manager. Launchy indexes and launches your applications, documents, project files, folders, and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes!

I have been using Launchy for years, and found that this project has not been updated since 2010. I love this tool and want to maintain this project.
