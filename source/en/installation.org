If LaunchyQt is already installed, this installation is a software upgrade, please see the next chapter *Upgrade Guide* .


** Requirements
LaunchyQt currently supports Windows 7/8/10 and does not require additional dependencies.
Linux and MacOS versions are under development.


** Download
Download the latest version of LaunchyQt from [[https://github.com/samsonwang/LaunchyQt/releases][Github]] or [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/launchyqt/files/][Sourceforge]].
There is no difference between the =7z= and the =zip= package in the same name. Usually the =7z= package is smaller, and the =zip= package is only for users who don't have the =7z= extraction software installed.


** Installation
The LaunchyQt installation package is a zipped file that can be extracted in any given directory.
After unzipping, the software could run. By default, LaunchyQt will run in *installed mode*.


** Installed Mode and Portable Mode
LaunchyQt has two modes: *installed mode* and *portable mode*. The difference between the two is mainly the storage location of the program configuration.
When LaunchyQt starts, it checks if there is a =config/launchy.ini= file in the software directory. If this file exists, the software will run in portable mode, otherwise the software will run in installed mode.
In the LaunchyQt option dialog, two modes can be switched.


*** Installed Mode
When running in installed mode, the configuration files for LaunchyQt are stored in the user configuration directory specified by the operating system.
The directory for the Windows platform is =C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Launchy= .

*** Portable Mode
When running in portable mode, the configuration files for LaunchyQt are stored in the =config= directory of program directory.
In portable mode, all the program configurations and executable files are stored in only one directory, which is convenient to be stored in a USB flash drive and move around.
*Tips:* Before you reinstall your system, you can save the user configuration by switching the installed mode to portable mode.
